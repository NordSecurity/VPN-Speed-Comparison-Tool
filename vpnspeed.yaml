    # The VPN country and target country can be provided

    # 
    #   - us:us
    # 
    # where the first country code is the VPN country, and the second
    # is the speed test target country.
    # The long version looks as such:
    # 
    #   - vpn_country: us
    #     target_country: us
    # 
    # The last version is providing all desired VPN and target
    # countries in lists. In this case, each VPN country will be
    # paired with each target country.
    # In case the VPN or target country is not relevant, specify
    # `auto` instead of a country code.
